# 2023.516.1 - Digital key support, support for more keys!

This release adds support for digital keys, which might not be useful for minipad owners *yet*, but is for people DIY-ing a keypad or messing around with the firmware, as well as the collaboratoring commercial products of the Minipad Project. 

This release also prepares the communication with minitility, our configuration software which is coming closer to be ready to use.

## Features

- Added support for digital keys (push buttons, mechanical switches, ...)
- Added debounce for digital keys with a default of 50ms
- Made the amount of hall effect/digital keys fully dynamic, not limited to 2-3 but rather limited to the hardware specifications of the RP2040 micro controller

## Bug Fixes

- Refactored `getArgumentAt` function
- Fix `name` command not null-terminating

## Changes

- Migrated info retrieved via the `ping` to the `get` command
- Split the `key` identifier in the serial protocol into `hkey` (hall effect) and `dkey` (digital)
- Changed the command for changing the key pressed from `key` to `char`
- Removed config versions other than the main `Configuration` object, removed mutations
- Switched from hardcoded pin arrays to a formula macro
- Changed the default values for rest and down positions to 4095 and 0 respectively
- Added definition for reversing the sensor values
